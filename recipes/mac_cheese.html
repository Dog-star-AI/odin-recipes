    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <li>2 cups elbow macaroni (or any short pasta)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1½ cups shredded cheddar cheese (or a mix of cheeses)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Method:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the pasta: </strong>Boil the macaroni in salted water according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the roux: </strong>In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the milk: </strong>Gradually whisk in the milk to avoid lumps. Cook until the mixture thickens, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Melt the cheese: </strong>Stir in the shredded cheese until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine: </strong>Add the cooked pasta to the cheese sauce and mix until evenly coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional baking: </strong>Transfer to a baking dish, sprinkle with breadcrumbs, and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 15-20 minutes for a crispy top.</li>
    </ol>
